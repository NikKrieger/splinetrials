Description: Create mixed models with repeated measures using natural
    cubic splines applied to an observed continuous time variable, as
    described by Donohue et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/pst.2285>. Iterate
    through multiple covariance structure types until one converges.
    Categorize observed time according to scheduled visits. Perform
    subgroup analyses.
